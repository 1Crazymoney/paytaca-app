# Paytaca - Secure and convenient Bitcoin Cash wallet app

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another. It is sound money for the modern internet world.

The Paytaca wallet brings this revolutionary cryptocurrency to everyone everywhere. We have the app built for the browser, mobile, and desktop with features that are accessible and easy to use both by beginners and advanced users.

Paytaca wallet brings the power of BCH to the hands of every user, with their private keys solely under their custody giving them complete control of their own money.

The wallet supports not only BCH but also Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens built on top of BCH blockchain, which allows anyone to create fungible and non-fungible tokens for any real-world use case -- from reward systems to stablecoins, to digital collectibles, game items, and many more.

The current version now supports SmartBCH. The app allows for a seamless switch between the BCH main chain and SmartBCH side chain. It can facilitate sending and receiving of sBCH as well as SEP20 and SEP721 tokens.
